Dear CRAN

This is a regular update of the dendroTools R package. 
I have included additional options related to the aggregate function, and additional
option for the reference window position in the monthly_response(). The citation file is also updated.

In previous versions, we agreed to disable vignette checking on some platforms. I believe it makes sense to keep it that way.  

Best,   
Jernej
