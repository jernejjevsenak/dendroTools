Dear CRAN  

This is regular update of the dendroTools r package. There were just minor corrections related to the new functionality of the package, i.e. detrending climate data.

In previous versions, we agreed to disable vignette checking on some platforms. I believe it makes sense to keep it that way.  

Best,   
Jernej
