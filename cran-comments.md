Dear CRAN

This is regular update of the dendroTools R package. There were only minor changes related to default values of function arguments, improved description and correction of spelling errors. 

In previous versions, we agreed to disable vignette checking on some platforms. I believe it makes sense to keep it that way.  

Best,   
Jernej
