Dear CRAN, 
I am resubmitting my package dendroTools. I have tested new version on all platforms and all examples were finished successfully. 

Please note extensive vignette examples. In previous versions we agreed to turn off vignette checks on some platforms. I believe it makes sense to keep it so. Thank you very much.
Bests,
Jernej
