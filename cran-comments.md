Dear CRAN

This is regular update of the dendroTools r package. There were only minor corrections which ensure the proper functionality of the package. 
Please also note the extensive vignette examples. In previous versions, we agreed to disable vignette checking on some platforms. I believe it makes sense to keep it that way.

Many thanks at this point. 
Jernej
