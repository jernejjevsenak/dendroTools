##  First Submission

This is a first submission of the dendroTools package. Previously, package was called dendroExtra, but authors decided to publish the new version under new name dendroTools. There are several reasons for that:  1) there is already a package called dendroextras, which is very close to dendroExtra and 2) the future development of the package will be focused on the implementation of new tools, so the new name
is definately more appropriate. 

We kindly ask CRAN for understanding and to approve the change of the name of this package. Here, we ask CRAN, when dendroTools will be on CRAN, to remove the dendroExtra package from CRAN. 

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.4.0
* Ubuntu precise (Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS) (on travis-ci), R version 3.4.1 (2017-01-27)
