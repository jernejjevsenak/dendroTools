Dear CRAN  
This is regular update of the dendroTools r package.
I have also updated the vignette examples, which are now computationally less extensive, but I believe they will still exceed CRAN computational limits.  In previous versions, we agreed to disable vignette checking on some platforms. I believe it makes sense to keep it that way.  
Best,   
Jernej
