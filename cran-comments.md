Dear CRAN Team,

I am resubmitting the dendroTools R package in response to the feedback received on April 25. Your comments highlighted concerns regarding the execution speed of the example() function, particularly the parts within \donttest. You also noted the importance of including explanations for the use of \donttest.

The dendroTools package is designed primarily for aggregating daily climate data and calculating correlation coefficients with tree growth data. The examples in our package are inherently slow due to their need to process approximately 60,000 iterations of consecutive day combinations. Although the execution time is considerable, this functionality has significantly benefited dendroclimatological scientific community, leading to new research projects, numerous publications, workshops, etc.

Understanding CRAN’s need to manage the resources used during R package checks, I have introduced new arguments to reduce the number of iterations, which has halved the execution time of package tests on my local setup—from 12 minutes to 6 minutes. I am prepared to further reduce the number of examples if required.

Additionally, I have updated all function documentation to explain the necessity of \donttest{}. For example, documentation now states: “The examples below are enclosed within donttest{} to minimize execution time during R package checks. These examples use the parameters skip_window_length and skip_window_position to limit the number of evaluated combinations in climate-growth correlation studies. For comprehensive testing, users should set both parameters to 1.”

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Jernej
