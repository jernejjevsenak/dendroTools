Dear CRAN

This is regular update of the dendroTools r package. There was one major update and some minor as well.

Please also note the extensive vignette examples. In previous versions, we agreed to disable vignette checking on some platforms. I believe it makes sense to keep it that way.

Many thanks at this point. 
Jernej
