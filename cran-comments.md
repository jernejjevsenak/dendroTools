Dear CRAN Team,

This is a routine update (version 1.2.14) of the dendroTools R package.

A minor bug in the aggregation function—which only occurred in extremely rare cases—has been fixed. In addition, per CRAN’s feedback, an Authors@R field has been added to DESCRIPTION.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Jernej Jevsenak
