Dear CRAN, 
I am resubmitting my package dendroTools. I have added three new functions that extends the functionality of my package. Please note extensive vignette examples. In previous versions we agreed to turn off vignette checks on some platforms. I believe it makes sense to keep it so. Thank you very much.
Bests,
Jernej
