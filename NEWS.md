# dendroTools 0.0.3.

* Package was previously called dendroExtra, but authors decided to rename it and submit it as a new package
* Reasons for that are: 1) there is already a package called dendroextras, which is very close to dendroExtra,
* 2) the future development of the package will be focused on the implementation of new tools, so the new name
* is definately more appropriate.

* Changes in comparison to the package dendroExtra 0.0.2
* new dataset is added that is used to test new function compare_methods()
* two new functions are added: compare_methods() and calculate_measures()
* required packages were added to the Description: dcv (>= 0.1.1), MLmetrics (>= 1.1.1), RWeka (>= 0.4-34),
        dplyr (>= 0.7.0), reshape (>= 0.8.6)
