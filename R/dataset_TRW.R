#' TRW and mean June -  JUly temperature from Albania
#'
#' A dataset with a tree-ring width (TRW) chronology of Pinus nigra from Albania and mean
#' June-July temperature. This TRW chronology has a span of 59 years (period 2009 - 1951)
#' and was already used to reconstruct summer temperatures by Levanič et al. (2015).
#' In this paper, all the details about sample replication, site description and correlation
#' statistics are described.
